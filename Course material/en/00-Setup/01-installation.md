# Setting Up Your Environment

**Welcome!** Before we start coding, we need to set up your computer. Think of this like buying your ingredients before cooking a meal.

Don't worry if you've never done this before. Just follow the steps one by one.

## 1. Get a Web Browser

You probably already have this! We recommend **Google Chrome** because it has excellent tools for developers.

- **Download:** [google.com/chrome](https://google.com/chrome)
- **Install:** Run the file you downloaded and follow the instructions.

---

## 2. Get a Text Editor (VS Code)

This is where you will write your code. It's like Microsoft Word, but for programming.

- **Download:** [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Install:**
  1. Download the version for your computer (Windows or Mac).
  2. Run the installer.
  3. Click "Next" through the options. Default settings are fine!

## 3. Install Node.js

This is a tool that lets your computer run JavaScript outside of the browser. It's essential for modern web development.

- **Download:** [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Important:** Choose the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version. It's the most stable.
- **Install:** Run the installer and click "Next" until it's done.

## 4. Setup VS Code Extensions

Extensions make VS Code more powerful.

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (it looks like four squares).
3. Search for and install these:
   - **Prettier - Code formatter** (Makes your code look neat)
   - **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** (Shortcuts for React)
   - **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** (Helps with styling later)

## 5. Create Your Project Folder

We need a place to keep all your work.

1. Go to your **Desktop** (minimize all windows).
2. Right-click on an empty space -> **New** -> **Folder**.
3. Name it `coding-course`.
4. Open **VS Code**.
5. Go to **File** -> **Open Folder**.
6. Select your new `coding-course` folder.

**You are now ready to start!** 🎉
