## What is the T3 Stack?

The **T3 Stack** is a popular way to build web apps that focuses on _simplicity, modularity, and full-stack type safety_.

It is not a framework itself, but a combination of the best tools:

1. **TyepScript**: JavaScript with safety rules.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Styling without writing .css files.
3. **tRPC**: Connecting frontend and backend without an API schema.
4. **Prisma / Drizzle**: Talking to your database.
5. **NextAuth / BetterAuth**: Handling user logins.
6. **Next.js**: The framework holding it all together.

- **Lesson 2: Tailwind CSS** - Styling at the speed of thought.

### Phase 2: The Backend & Data

- **Lesson 3: Databases with Drizzle** - Storing your data permanently.
- **Lesson 4: Authentication** - BetterAuth & NextAuth.

### Phase 3: The Glue

- **Lesson 5: tRPC** - Calling backend functions from the frontend.

## Why this stack?

Have you ever changed a database name and forgot to update the frontend code? T3 prevents this. If you change something in the database, your frontend code will turn red immediately. This is "End-to-End Type Safety".
