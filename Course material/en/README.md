## 📖 How to Study

### The Golden Rules

1. **Type everything yourself**

   > Don't copy and paste code. Typing builds muscle memory.

2. **Make mistakes deliberately**

   > Break things, then fix them. Errors teach more than successes.

3. **Build more than you read**

   > 20% reading, 80% coding.

4. **Explain concepts out loud**

   > If you can teach it, you understand it.

5. **Take breaks**
   > Learning happens during rest. Step away when stuck.

### Study Schedule

**Recommended: 1-2 hours per day**

- Better to study 1 hour daily than 7 hours on Sunday
- Your brain needs time to absorb new concepts
- Consistency beats intensity
