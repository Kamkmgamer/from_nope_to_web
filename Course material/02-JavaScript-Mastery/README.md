## Lesson Breakdown

### Lesson 1: Variables (30 min)

_Storing and naming data_

- What is a variable?
- `let` vs `const` vs `var`
- Data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Template literals
- Basic operators
- Using the console

**Key Concepts:** Variables, Data Types, Operators

---

### Lesson 2: Functions (40 min)

_Reusable blocks of code_

- What is a function?
- Function declarations vs expressions
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Arrow functions (modern syntax)
- Scope (local vs global)
- Array methods that use functions

**Project:** Build a calculator

### Lesson 3: Control Flow (35 min)

_Making decisions and repeating actions_

- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- If/else statements
- Ternary operator
- Switch statements
- For loops
- While loops
- For...of and for...in
- Break and continue

**Project:** FizzBuzz and guessing game

---

### Lesson 4: Objects and Arrays (40 min)

_Organizing complex data_

- Creating and accessing objects
- Object methods and `this`
- Creating and accessing arrays
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, find)
- Sorting arrays
- Destructuring
- Spread operator
- Combining objects and arrays

**Project:** Build a todo list data structure

---

### Lesson 5: Asynchronous JavaScript (45 min)

_Handling things that take time_

- Synchronous vs asynchronous
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/await
- Fetch API
- Error handling with try/catch
- Working with APIs

**Project:** Weather app using a real API

---

### Lesson 6: DOM Manipulation (45 min)

_Changing webpages with code_

- What is the DOM?
- Selecting elements
- Changing content and styles
- Creating and removing elements

## How to Study

1. **Use the browser console** - Test code snippets immediately
2. **Make mistakes** - Errors teach you more than successes
3. **Debug patiently** - Read error messages carefully
4. **Build projects** - Don't just read, create!
5. **Solve problems** - Try coding challenges on sites like:
   - [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)
   - [Codewars](https://codewars.com)
   - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
